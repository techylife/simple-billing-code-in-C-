# Simple Billing System
This is a simple billing system built from scratch using C++. It doesn't use any extra libraries but only the in-build libraries of C++.

## Usage
Using this billing system is very simple. You just have to put the [simple_billing.cpp](./src/simple_billing.cpp) file inside the src folder of your project. Then you have to call the function to your required file, here for me it is [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp). For more reference on how to use the system, please open [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp).
